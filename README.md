# AcousticCamera
An acoustic camera is just like a regular optical camera, but is used to photograph sound instead. Our project's aim is to create an open source acoustic camera with capabilities similar to commercially available devices, but at significantly lower cost.


## Basic Working
The acoustic camera consists of an array of mics. Sound from these mics are sampled and processed by a delay-and-sum beamforming algorithm. The result is a heatmap corresponding to intensities of sound from different points in space, thus resembling in a false colour image of 'sound'.
